Subject: Proposal for Migrating Automic AROW Jobs to Apache Airflow

Dear [Leadership Team],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to provide an overview of the proposed migration of our current job scheduling and automation system from Automic AROW to Apache Airflow. As part of our ongoing efforts to streamline operations and leverage modern, scalable technologies, this transition represents a significant step forward. Below, I have outlined the key points of this migration, the challenges we may face, and the benefits we can anticipate.

Overview of the Current System

Currently, our job scheduling and automation tasks are managed using Automic AROW, with the underlying infrastructure based on Amazon EC2 instances. While this system has served us well, it presents several limitations, including:

Higher maintenance costs and operational complexity.
Difficulty in scaling and integrating with newer technologies.
Limited flexibility for developing and orchestrating complex workflows.
Why Apache Airflow?

Apache Airflow is an open-source platform designed for orchestrating complex workflows and data pipelines. It offers several advantages over our existing system:

Scalability: Easily scales to handle increased workflow complexity and data volume.
Flexibility: Supports a wide range of integrations and can orchestrate tasks across different systems and platforms.
Visualization: Provides a robust web-based user interface for monitoring and managing workflows.
Community and Support: Benefits from a large open-source community and extensive documentation.
Challenges and Migration Strategy

Migrating from Automic AROW to Apache Airflow involves several challenges, primarily due to the differences in how the two systems operate and the need to refactor scripts designed for EC2 infrastructure. Key challenges include:

Script Refactoring: Significant effort required to refactor existing scripts to be compatible with Airflow operators and infrastructure.
Infrastructure Transition: Shifting from a primarily EC2-based infrastructure to potentially more cloud-native services (e.g., AWS Lambda, ECS).
Training and Adoption: Ensuring our team is trained and comfortable with the new system to leverage its full capabilities.
To address these challenges, I propose the following migration strategy:

Assessment and Planning: Conduct a thorough assessment of existing Automic AROW jobs and dependencies to prioritize migration tasks.
Pilot Migration: Select a few critical jobs for a pilot migration to Apache Airflow to refine our approach and identify potential issues early.
Incremental Migration: Gradually migrate batches of jobs, starting with less complex tasks and progressing to more complex workflows.
Infrastructure Optimization: Leverage cloud-native services where appropriate to optimize performance and reduce operational overhead.
Training and Support: Provide comprehensive training and support to the team throughout the migration process.
Conclusion

Migrating to Apache Airflow presents a strategic opportunity to modernize our workflow orchestration capabilities, improve scalability, and reduce operational complexity. While the migration involves a substantial level of effort, the long-term benefits far outweigh the initial challenges. I recommend proceeding with the assessment and planning phase to initiate this transition.

I look forward to discussing this proposal further and addressing any questions you may have.
